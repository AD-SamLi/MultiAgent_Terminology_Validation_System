extrude command,extrude command,"CAD command that creates 3D geometry by projecting 2D profiles along a path or direction, commonly used in solid modeling and design.","Use the extrude command to create 3D geometry from 2D profiles."
chamfer feature,chamfer feature,"CAD feature that bevels or angles sharp edges and corners to meet manufacturing requirements and design specifications.","Apply chamfer feature to edges for manufacturing requirements."
loft feature,loft feature,"CAD feature that generates smooth surfaces by blending transitions between multiple cross-sectional profiles or curves.","The loft feature creates smooth transitions between multiple profiles."
tolerance constraints,tolerance constraints,"Engineering specifications that define acceptable dimensional variations and precision requirements for manufactured components.","Configure tolerance constraints for precision manufacturing."
revolve operation,revolve operation,"CAD modeling operation that generates cylindrical and curved 3D geometry by rotating a 2D profile around an axis.","The revolve operation generates cylindrical and curved geometry."
symmetry plane,symmetry plane,"Geometric reference plane used in CAD to create mirrored or symmetric component designs and assemblies.","Enable symmetry plane for mirrored component design."
fillet radius,fillet radius,"CAD parameter that defines the curvature applied to smooth and round sharp corners and edges in 3D models.","Adjust fillet radius to smooth sharp corners and edges."
sweep feature,sweep feature,"CAD modeling feature that creates complex 3D shapes by sweeping a cross-sectional profile along a specified path or trajectory.","The sweep feature follows a path to create complex shapes."
