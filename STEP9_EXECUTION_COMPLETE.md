# Linux
libreoffice Approved_Terms_Export.csv

# Or open in Excel/Google Sheets
```

### **2. Review Process:**

## 🔄 Next Steps (Optional)

### **If LLM-Generated Descriptions Needed:**

To enhance descriptions with Azure OpenAI GPT-4.1:

```bash
# Run full Step 9 with LLM
python agentic_terminology_validation_system.py \
    --input PRDSMRT_doc_merged_results_Processed_Simple.csv \
    --resume-from prdsmrt_full_validation_output_20251001_00000
```

This will:
- Use GPT-4.1 to analyze ALL original_texts
- Generate more sophisticated professional descriptions
- Keep the same 10-sample context column
- Take 2-5 minutes for 599 terms

### **Current vs LLM Descriptions:**

**Current (Rule-Based):**
```
"Technical term used in manufacturing and production management"
```

**With LLM (Example):**
```
"Feature that allows creating and managing product configurations in CAD 
software, including bill of materials, production orders, and inventory tracking"
```
