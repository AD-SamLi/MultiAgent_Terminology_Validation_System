# üîç Step 2 Authentication Failure Analysis

**Date:** October 2, 2025  
**Issue:** Terms marked as "Analysis failed after 3 attempts" in Step 2  
**Impact:** Terms incorrectly classified as "found in glossary"

---

## üìã Problem Description

When the terminology agent encounters persistent authentication issues during Step 2 (Glossary Validation), it returns the message:

```
"Analysis failed after 3 attempts due to persistent authentication issues. Term requires manual review."
```

### Current Behavior

**The problem:** These terms are being classified as **"found in glossary"** (existing terms) instead of **"new terms"**.

## üîç Root Cause Analysis

### Where the Error Message Originates

**File:** `terminology_agent.py`, Lines 115-135

```python
def run_with_retries(agent, prompt: str, max_retries: int = 3):
    """Run agent with intelligent retry logic with cleanup on final failure"""
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            # Token refresh logic...
            return agent.run(prompt)
            
        except Exception as exc:
            error_msg = str(exc)
            print(f"‚ö†Ô∏è [TerminologyAgent] Attempt {attempt + 1} failed: {error_msg}")
            
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                print(f"‚ùå [TerminologyAgent] All {max_retries} attempts failed.")
                # Returns this message instead of raising exception:
                return f"Analysis failed after {max_retries} attempts due to persistent authentication issues. Term requires manual review."
```

### How Terms Are Classified

**File:** `agentic_terminology_validation_system.py`, Lines 117-133

```python
# Convert to lowercase and check for "not found" indicators
analysis_lower = analysis_result.lower() if isinstance(analysis_result, str) else ''

if ("no recognized glossary terminology terms were found" in analysis_lower or 
    "no glossary terms" in analysis_lower or
    "no terms found" in analysis_lower or
    "no task provided" in analysis_lower or
    "no task was provided" in analysis_lower):
    # Term NOT found in glossary
    results.append({
        'term': clean_term,
        'found': False,
        'analysis': 'Not found in glossary'
    })
else:
    # Term FOUND in glossary (DEFAULT CASE)
    results.append({
        'term': clean_term,
        'found': True,  # ‚ùå WRONG for auth failures!
        'analysis': analysis_result
    })
```

### The Bug

**The authentication failure message does NOT match any of the "not found" patterns**, so it falls through to the `else` block and is incorrectly marked as `'found': True`.

This means:
- ‚úÖ Terms with successful analysis ‚Üí correctly classified
- ‚úÖ Terms explicitly "not found" ‚Üí correctly classified as new
- ‚ùå **Terms with auth failures ‚Üí INCORRECTLY marked as "found in glossary"**

---

## üìä Impact Assessment

### From Your Data

**File:** `Glossary_Analysis_Results.json`

Found **46 terms** with authentication failures:
- enable, disable, join, query, approval, billable, enables, register inventory, username, new orders, specific group, movements table, deactivate, mandatory operations, together, material request actions, 1024x768, nested, though, collecting data, add wastes, already existing, configurable sales, techniques, number of hours, estimated end date, providing information, real-time dashboards, suggested, document creation, show disabled, import multiple suppliers, etc.

### Classification Consequence

**These 46 terms were:**
1. ‚ùå Marked as `found: true` (existing glossary terms)
2. ‚ùå Added to `glossary_results['existing_terms']` instead of `new_terms`
3. ‚ùå Excluded from Steps 3-9 processing
4. ‚ùå Never translated, validated, or approved

**They should have been:**
1. ‚úÖ Marked as `found: false` (new terms) OR marked with special status
2. ‚úÖ Added to `glossary_results['new_terms']`
3. ‚úÖ Processed through the full pipeline
4. ‚úÖ Given a chance for translation and approval

## üîß The Fix

### Option 1: Add Error Pattern to "Not Found" Detection (Recommended)

**File:** `agentic_terminology_validation_system.py`, Lines 118-122

```python
# Add authentication failure to "not found" patterns
analysis_lower = analysis_result.lower() if isinstance(analysis_result, str) else ''

if ("no recognized glossary terminology terms were found" in analysis_lower or 
    "no glossary terms" in analysis_lower or
    "no terms found" in analysis_lower or
    "no task provided" in analysis_lower or
    "no task was provided" in analysis_lower or
    "analysis failed" in analysis_lower or           # NEW: Catch auth failures
    "authentication issues" in analysis_lower or     # NEW: Catch auth issues
    "requires manual review" in analysis_lower):     # NEW: Catch manual review flag
    # Term NOT found in glossary (or couldn't be analyzed)
    results.append({
        'term': clean_term,
        'found': False,
        'analysis': analysis_result  # Keep original error message for tracking
    })
```

### Option 2: Add Special "Error" Classification

Create a third category for terms that failed analysis:

```python
if ("no recognized glossary terminology terms were found" in analysis_lower or 
    "no glossary terms" in analysis_lower or
    "no terms found" in analysis_lower):
    # Term NOT found in glossary
    results.append({
        'term': clean_term,
        'found': False,
        'analysis': 'Not found in glossary'
    })
elif ("analysis failed" in analysis_lower or
      "authentication issues" in analysis_lower or
      "requires manual review" in analysis_lower):
    # Term analysis FAILED - treat as new term for safety
    results.append({
        'term': clean_term,
        'found': False,
        'analysis': analysis_result,
        'analysis_status': 'error_requires_review'  # Special flag
    })
else:
    # Term FOUND in glossary
    results.append({
        'term': clean_term,
        'found': True,
        'analysis': analysis_result
    })
```

### Option 3: More Robust Error Detection

```python
# Check for error indicators first
is_error = (
    "error" in analysis_lower or
    "failed" in analysis_lower or
    "authentication" in analysis_lower or
    "manual review" in analysis_lower or
    "rate limit" in analysis_lower or
    "429" in analysis_lower  # HTTP 429 rate limit
)

if is_error:
    # Treat errors as new terms to ensure they get processed
    results.append({
        'term': clean_term,
        'found': False,
        'analysis': analysis_result,
        'requires_manual_review': True
    })
elif ("no recognized glossary terminology terms were found" in analysis_lower or 
      "no glossary terms" in analysis_lower or
      "no terms found" in analysis_lower):
    results.append({
        'term': clean_term,
        'found': False,
        'analysis': 'Not found in glossary'
    })
else:
    results.append({
        'term': clean_term,
        'found': True,
        'analysis': analysis_result
    })
```

## üéØ Recommended Solution

**Use Option 1 with slight enhancement:**

```python
# Enhanced error detection in Step 2 glossary validation
analysis_lower = analysis_result.lower() if isinstance(analysis_result, str) else ''

# Check for "not found" or "error" patterns
is_not_found_or_error = (
    "no recognized glossary terminology terms were found" in analysis_lower or 
    "no glossary terms" in analysis_lower or
    "no terms found" in analysis_lower or
    "no task provided" in analysis_lower or
    "no task was provided" in analysis_lower or
    # Error patterns - treat as new terms for safety
    "analysis failed" in analysis_lower or
    "authentication issues" in analysis_lower or
    "requires manual review" in analysis_lower or
    "rate limit" in analysis_lower or
    "error code: 429" in analysis_lower
)

if is_not_found_or_error:
    results.append({
        'term': clean_term,
        'found': False,
        'analysis': analysis_result  # Preserve original message
    })
else:
    results.append({
        'term': clean_term,
        'found': True,
        'analysis': analysis_result
    })
```

**Why this is best:**
1. ‚úÖ Minimal code change
2. ‚úÖ Treats errors conservatively (as new terms)
3. ‚úÖ Preserves error messages for debugging
4. ‚úÖ Ensures no terms are lost due to auth issues
5. ‚úÖ Maintains backward compatibility

## üìù Testing the Fix

### After Applying the Fix

1. **Re-run Step 2** on the existing dataset
2. **Expected result:** All 46 auth-failed terms should now appear in `new_terms` instead of `existing_terms`
3. **Verify:** Check `Glossary_Analysis_Results.json` - terms like "enable", "disable", "join" should be in `new_terms` array
4. **Downstream:** These terms should now flow through Steps 3-9 and potentially get approved

### Validation Checklist

- [ ] Auth-failed terms now in `new_terms` array
- [ ] Terms still have original error message for tracking
- [ ] No legitimate glossary matches are misclassified
- [ ] Step 3 processes these terms correctly
- [ ] Final approval count increases (some may get approved)

## üîÑ Recovery for Existing Data

### For Your Current Run

The 46 terms that failed auth are currently in `existing_terms`. To recover them:

**Option A: Re-run Step 2 only** (after applying fix)
```bash
# Delete Step 2 results
rm prdsmrt_full_validation_output_20251001_153014/Glossary_Analysis_Results.json
rm prdsmrt_full_validation_output_20251001_153014/step2_checkpoint.json

# Re-run from Step 2
python agentic_terminology_validation_system.py \
    --input PRDSMRT_doc_merged_results_Processed_Simple.csv \
    --resume-from prdsmrt_full_validation_output_20251001_153014
```

**Option B: Manual rescue** (add them to new_terms)
1. Load `Glossary_Analysis_Results.json`
2. Find all terms with "Analysis failed after 3 attempts"
3. Move them from `existing_terms` to `new_terms`
4. Re-run from Step 3
