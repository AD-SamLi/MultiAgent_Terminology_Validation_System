## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Performance Issues
**Slower than expected processing**:

- Check for memory bottlenecks

**High memory usage**:
- Reduce `checkpoint_interval` for more frequent cleanup
- Decrease `max_queue_size` 
- Disable `predictive_caching` temporarily
- Monitor with `ultra_optimized_monitor.py`

### Quality Concerns
**Too many terms using ultra-minimal**:
- Lower `ultra_minimal_threshold` (e.g., 0.2)
- Increase `ultra_core_threshold` (e.g., 0.9)
- Check term categorization logic

**Insufficient language coverage**:
- Disable ultra-aggressive mode temporarily
- Add validation sampling for quality check
- Review expansion threshold settings

### Resumption Issues
**Cannot resume from checkpoint**:
- Use `universal_smart_resume.py --list` to see available sessions
- Check checkpoint file integrity
- Try resuming with `--optimized` flag for automatic detection
